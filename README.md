# Code Refactor

## Purpose
Being given base HTML and CSS, this project refactors the code to meet accessibility standards.

## Tasks

1. Edit the source code to create semantic HTML elements

``` HTML
<section id="online-reputation-management" class="sections">

    <!-- Online Reputation Management image -->
    <img src="./assets/images/online-reputation-management.jpg" class="float-right" alt="Online Reputation Management" />

    <!-- Online Reputation Management heading -->
    <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>

    <!-- Online Reputation Management description paragraph -->
    <p>
    The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.
    </p>
</section>
```

2. Organize the elements so that they follow a logical structure.
3. Give alt attributes to all of the images.
4. Make the title concise but descriptive.
